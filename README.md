# file_checker
First you run the backup script: backup.sh is targeted at your /etc directory, but of course you could modify the script to archive/hash any directory you want.  It uses the find command to output all of the files in /etc and executes an md5 sum on each, while also archiving them. If you want to check if the files are the same later on, you simply run the integrity_check.sh script, which then outputs a report about files that have been added to the directory, files deleted from the directory, and a list of line-by-line changes to any files that have been modified.
